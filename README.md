# jira-incident-counter

Originally a whiteboard joke to cope with failing document generation at work. Just wanted to take the joke a bit further by automating it.

Notes:

Currently work in progress.
My plan is to implement it on an ESP32. I'll switch from Python to C++ most likely. Eventually, I'd like to also add my own trained ML model to detect more nuanced issues. Potentially even have it train itself.

To-do list:
- [ ] ESP32 firmware rewrite in C++
- [ ] Connect to Wi-Fi and fetch data
- [ ] Working OLED display
- [ ] Manual reset button
- [ ] Rechargeable battery support
- [ ] Simple ML model
- [ ] Automatic model training
